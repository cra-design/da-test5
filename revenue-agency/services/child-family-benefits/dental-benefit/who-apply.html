            <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg">

            </ul>
            <p>There were 2 types of payments for this benefit. The original payment was for dental care received in the specific period you applied for. The additional payment was available if your child had dental costs that were more than $650 in one of the benefit periods. The eligibility criteria was specific to the period when your child received dental care and the type of payment you received.</p>

            <p>The CRA regularly checks to confirm if people were eligible for the payments they received.</p>
            <p>If your application is selected for review, we may ask for more information to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/dental-benefit/validation.html">validate your application</a>. If you are found to be ineligible or cannot provide the required information, you will have to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/dental-benefit/return-payment.html">return a payments</a> you received.</p>
            <p>If you are found to have misrepresented or concealed essential information to make a claim, you were ineligible for the benefit.</p>
            <p>Penalties may also be applied if you had knowingly provided false or misleading information.</p>
            <p>To report suspected misuse, go to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">CRA's Leads program</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="mpct">Impact on your taxes</h2>
            <p>The Canada Dental Benefit payment is not taxable. You do not need to report it as income on your tax return.</p>
            <p>If you claim dental costs as medical expenses for your child on line 33099, you can only claim expenses that have not or will not be reimbursed. This means you will need to deduct your Canada Dental Benefit payment from any dental costs you claim as medical expenses for your child.</p>
