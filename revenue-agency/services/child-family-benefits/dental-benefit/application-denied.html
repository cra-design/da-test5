<p>If your application is denied and you do not agree with the decision, you may ask to have your application reviewed again.</p>
<p>Your request for a second review must be submitted <strong>within 90 days</strong> of the decision and include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The reasons why you disagree with the decision (such as, not all of the information was considered, certain facts or details were missing, or misinterpreted)</li>
    <li>Any relevant new documents, new facts, or correspondence</li>
    <li>Your current home address and phone number</li>
</ul>
<p>To maintain impartiality and transparency, the second review will not be done by the same CRA official who did the first review.</p>
