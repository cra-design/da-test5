        <p>The interim Canada Dental Benefit was intended to help lower dental costs for eligible families earning less than $90,000 per year. Parents and guardians may have been eligible if they paid for dental care for a child under 12 years old who did not have access to a private dental insurance plan.</p>
        <p>A tax-free payment of $260, $390, or $650 was available for each eligible child based what your adjusted family net income was.</p>
        <p>The benefit provided up to 2 payments per child for dental care <strong>between October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2022 and June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2024</strong>.</p>
        <p>This interim benefit was administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p>
